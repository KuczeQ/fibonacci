**Fibonacci Series Generator**

This C program generates and prints the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

**How to Use:**

1. Open a C compiler on your system.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a new C source code file (e.g., `fibonacci.c`).
3. Save the file.
4. Compile the code using the C compiler to create an executable program. For example, if you're using the GCC compiler, you can use the command: `gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci`.
5. Run the generated executable by entering its name in the terminal or command prompt: `./fibonacci`.

**Program Explanation:**

1. The `fibonacci()` function is defined to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns `n`, as the Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1.
2. If `n` is greater than 1, the function calculates the nth Fibonacci number by recursively calling `fibonacci(n - 1)` and `fibonacci(n - 2)` and adding their results.
3. In the `main()` function:
   - The user is prompted to enter the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci series.
   - The program reads the user input using `scanf()` and stores it in the variable `n`.
   - A loop runs from 0 to `n - 1`, and for each iteration, it calculates and prints the Fibonacci number at that position using the `fibonacci()` function.
4. The program terminates after printing the Fibonacci series.

**Note:**

While this program demonstrates the concept of generating Fibonacci numbers using recursion, it is not the most efficient approach for larger values of `n`. Recalculating Fibonacci numbers using recursion leads to redundant calculations and exponential time complexity. To generate larger Fibonacci series efficiently, consider using an iterative approach or applying memoization to store previously calculated values.

This program is suitable for educational purposes and exploring recursive programming concepts. For production use or generating larger Fibonacci series, alternative methods that improve efficiency should be employed.
